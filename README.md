Simple and Flexible
===================
The basic idea of this project ( currently codenamed snowbank ), is to provide a very simple framework that provides a way of relating and accessing different data types, even from disparit systems.

The system should be customizable enough that it can be used
 * as a ticket system
 * as an asset tracking system
 * for customer relationship management
 * for inventory and order management

Users will be able to define what can and cannot be referenced, how it is referenced, as well as the ability to create arbitrary documents and data types.

API
===
The API is currently being developed as a simple GET / POST system.

Documentation and available features for the API will be made available through the API; allowing end programs to dynamically change, based on what is and is not available.
